MNGTranslator
by YNOP (ynop@acm.org)

Translator to support MNG/JNG files via the TranKit for BeOS.

Notes:
	You must have libmng.so installed on your system... it can be found here.

	Due to the fact that zlib.so is a clever little lib that it seem is hard to find and sneeky.  And it seems that there may be more than one of them out there.. I am includeing the version I linked agains.
Just drag this into the config/lib folder and your good to go.

Ver 1.2:
	Mostly rearanged the lib stuff, should be easyer to install now
	Fixed some of the issuse with loading animatioins.
Ver 1.1:
	Fixed up the code some to make it nicer
	Added better support for MNG (animated) files
	Nolonger takes control of the PNG translation already in BeOS
	Faster Identify() method
	I now have a clear understanding of the MNG lib :)
Ver 1.0:
 	Translates MNG/JNG/PNG files
	Does not write
	Takes control from old PNG trans but works great.
